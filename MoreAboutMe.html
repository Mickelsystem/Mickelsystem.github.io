<p>Hi, my name is Sean Mickelson and welcome to my website. As you know, I am a Marketing major at the University of Maine. My hometown is Middletown Maryland. I have lived there my whole life and also went to high school there. In high school I was very active in sports. My freshman year I played basketball and lacrosse, both on the JV level. In my last three years however, I quit basketball and played lacrosse and Ice Hockey on the Varsity level. My senior year I was awarded first team all state in hockey and second team all area in lacrosse. I also took three computer graphics classes to help give me an edge in the marketing field. Since I've gotten to Maine, I have made the Men's club Ice Hockey Team and have begun pledging a fraternity. I have really enjoyed the Univerity of Maine so far and am excited for my next few years here.  </p>
